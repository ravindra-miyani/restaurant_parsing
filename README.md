Given the attached CSV file, write a function find_open_restaurants(filename, day, time) which takes as parameters a filename, a day (Mon-Fri) and a time (in hh:mm format) and returns a list of restaurant names that are open on that day and time.

Assumptions:

1. If a day of the week is not listed, the restaurant is closed on that day
2. All times are local — don’t worry about timezone-awareness
3. The CSV file will be well-formed
